I am in my early twenties and currently working towards receiving my Bachelor's Degree in Business. My interest in fitness and nutrition originated from my transition to veganism. Though I went vegan because I care about the treatment and wellbeing of all animals, it led me to learn so much about nutrition and fitness for the wellbeing of people.">

I was born and raised in the Cambridge/Isanti area and graduated from Cambridge/Isanti High School. I joined Anytime Fitness as a member in 2015 to lose the weight I had put on over the years and couldn’t seem to get off. I found my love for fitness again and lost 80 lbs while doing it. In 2017, I joined Anytime Fitness as a Trainer in our Isanti location before moving to our North Branch location. I cant wait to help you achieve your health and fitness related goals.">
